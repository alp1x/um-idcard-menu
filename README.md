This is a simple **[um-idcard](https://github.com/alp1x/um-idcard)** menu that allows you to select an identity card. Once you have selected a card, it is provided to you and the option to obtain the same card again is disabled.

## Permissions support
Currently supports checking if user has permissions to get the card. But only on Qbox Framework.
